<p>four-part satirical work by Anglo-Irish author <u>Jonathan Swift</u> </p>
<p> published anonymously in 1726 as Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World. A keystone of English literature, it was one of the books that gave birth to the novel form, though it did not yet have the rules of the genre as an organizing tool. A parody of the then popular travel narrative, Gulliver’s Travels combines <b> <i> adventure with savage satire, mocking English customs and the politics of the day</i> </b>.</p>
